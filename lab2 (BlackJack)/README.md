I decided to create the Black Jack game in java. This idea came 
while thinking about what to do. I didn't manage to make a game in 
the previous lab because of lack of time, so I decided to create one now.

This game contains 10 classes and 13 objects.

Classes:
-Main
-Table
-Player
-Dealer
-Cat
-Dog
-Security
-President
-Magician
-TheFlash

Objects:
-player1/player2/player3
-table
-dog
-cat
-barry
-dealer
-president
-nenea
-magician

This game is a spiced up BlackJack with some interesting features.

There is a test function to check some classes.
